steps:

- replace xgcc (in objdir/gcc) with the script (renaming the binary to xgcc-orig)

- dump gcc struct by:
 - running gdb on xgcc-orig
 - calling 'source gdb-dump-optstruct'
 - getting the addresses of the vars in dump-struct.txt

- update addresses on the file xgcc-addresses.in with the result from the previous step 
  - emacs' rectangle cut/yank (C-x r k and C-x r y) will help with that

- run xgcc

- check output file (xgcc-trace.out)


TODO:

- make it work with dejagnu test suite (currently having problems with the name of the old binary)
- repeat the process with the cc1 binary
  - xgcc invokes cc1 to perform the compilation. Both binaries have a global_options structure
- Update memorytrace.cpp with the correct size of the types (ex: 1-sized bools...)

to run a test:

$ make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="dg.exp=Werror-1.c"
