* steps:

- Update the variables in the scripts (need to work on that later)

- In the objdir/gcc folder:
  - replace xgcc with the provided script (renaming the binary to xgcc-orig)
  - replace cc1 with the provided script (renaming the binary to cc1-orig)

- Extract the pointers to the members of global_options (global
  variable of type gcc_options): 
  - run gdb on xgcc-orig/cc1-orig
  - execute 'source gdb-dump-optstruct' in the gdb prompt
  - update the input file ({xgcc|cc1}-addresses.in) with the pointers in
    dump-struct.txt
	- emacs' rectangle cut/yank (C-x r k and C-x r y) can help with that

- Run a test (ex: 'make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="dg.exp=Werror-1.c"')
  - Remember to execute the command from the objdir folder.

- check output files (xgcc-trace.out, cc1-trace.out)


* Notes

 - The code was tested on gcc 5.1.0, in a ubuntu x64 machine.

* TODO:

- Update memorytrace.cpp with the correct size of the types (ex: 1-sized bools...)
- Make it faster: instrumenting all memory access is too slow!
  - Currently, every memory access = one lookup in a map
- Make the scripts portable (or at least reuse the values of some variables)
